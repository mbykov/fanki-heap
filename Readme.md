#  a heap of the card's units for fanki

look https://github.com/mbykov/fanki

heap is a bunch of arbitrary subdirectories containing some files with sets (units) of cards as strings with fields separated by =

comments starts with #, so it is convenient to give files the extension as .md, because many text editors pretty highlight lines with # sign

as:

```
一月 = yí yuè = January
二月 = èr yuè = February
三月 = sān yuè = March
```

or
```
