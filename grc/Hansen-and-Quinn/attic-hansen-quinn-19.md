οὐ δὴ διὰ τὸ μὴ διδαχθῆναι ὑπὸ καλλῑόνων διδασκάλων ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι μηδὲν μαθεῖν ὅτι ἀφρονέστατα πρά̄ττουσιν οἵδε οἱ τρεῖς νεᾱνίαι. = (It is) not, in fact, on account of not having been taught by very noble teachers but on account of not being able to learn anything that these three young men act most foolishly.

τοὺς ἀπολωλότας ὑπὲρ τῆς ἡμετέρᾱς ἐλευθερίᾱς, ὄντας οὐκ ἐλαχίστους, τῑμᾷ ἡ πόλις. τίς γὰρ κακί̄ων ὢν οὕτως ἀφείη ἂν τόν γε βίον; = The city honors those who have died on behalf of our freedom, since they are not the least.  For who, being rather bad, could throw away his life in this way?

ὅσῳ πλέονες εἴημεν αἱ σοφαί, τοσούτῳ ῥᾷον τοιούτου γε δήμου ἄρξαιμεν ἄν. = The more (of us) wise women (there should be), the more easily we would rule such a people.
