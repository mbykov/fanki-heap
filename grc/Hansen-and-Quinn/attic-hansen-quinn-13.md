μὴ δῶτε χρῡσόν.        Do not give gold.
νόμους μὴ θῇς.              Do not make laws.
σταῖμεν ἂν ἐνταῦθα.        We could stand here.
ἐλθέτω ὁ ἑταῖρος.            Let the companion come.
ἀπόδου τὰ βιβλία.           Sell the books.
ταῦτα μὴ γένοιτο.              If only these things would not happen.
στῶ ἢ φύγω;                    Am I to stand, or run away?
ὅμοιοι τοῖσδε γένεσθε.    Become like these (men).
ἄργυρον δοίη.                  If only he gives silver.
ἔλθωμεν εἰς ἀγορά̄ν.        Let us go to the market place.

ἀγαθός που τὴν τέχνην οὗτος ὁ ζωγράφος, αἰσχρὸς δὲ τοὺς τρόπους. μηχανᾶται γὰρ μετὰ τῶν ἑταίρων ὅπως λύ̄σᾱς τὴν δημοκρατίᾱν πά̄σης τῆς πόλεως ἄρξει. = This painter is good, I suppose, with respect to his art, but shameful with respect to his ways (character).  For he is contriving with his companions that after destroying the democracy he will rule the whole city.

ἥκοντές ποτ’ εἰς τὴν πόλιν οἱ σύμμαχοι οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς νήσου ἦλθον αὐτίκα εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίᾱν ὅπως πείσειαν τοὺς ἄρχοντας νόμον θεῖναι περὶ τοῦ ξένων φόνου. ἐὰ̄ν γὰρ μὴ θῶσι τοῦτον τὸν νόμον, ἐκεῖνοι εἰς ἄλλον γε τόπον φυγεῖν βουλήσονται. = Having come sometime into the city, the allies from the island went immediately into the assembly so that they might persuade the rulers to make a law about the murder of foreigners.  For if they do not make this law, they (= the allies), at any rate, will want to flee to another place.

τῶν πολῑτῶν εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίᾱν ἐλθόντων, ταύτῃ τῇ μηχανῇ ἔπρᾱττεν ὁ Εὐρῑπίδης ὅπως ὑπὸ τῶν ἀφρόνων τῑμηθήσεται, ἀλλ’ οἱ σώφρονες στέφανον τούτῳ καὶ τοῖς τούτου χορευταῖς οὐκ ἔδοσαν. = After the citizens went into the assembly, Euripides was bringing it about by this device that he would be honored by the foolish, but the wise did not give him and his dancers a crown.

καὶ σοφὰ καὶ σαφῆ τὰ τοῦ Ὁμήρου ἔπη. οὐ γὰρ ταῦτα ὅμοια τοῖς ἄλλοις ἔπεσιν. = The epic poems of Homer are both wise and clear.  For these are not like the other epic poems.

εἴθε ὅμοιος γενοίμην Ἀριστοφάνει. = I wish that I would become like Aristophanes.

ἐὰ̄ν φοβηθῶμεν μὴ νῑκώμεθα, εἰς ἄλλον τόπον φευξόμεθα. = If we are afraid that we may be defeated, we will flee to another place.

ἡ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων κλέψᾱσα καὶ ἅμα πείσᾱσα ἄλλᾱς τὰ αὐτὰ πρά̄ττειν καὶ μὴ τοῖς θεοῖς θυσίᾱς ἄγουσα καὶ τοὺς νεᾱνίᾱς ἀδικεῖν διδάσκουσα ἔβλαπτε τὴν πᾶσαν πόλιν ἢ οὔ; δότω οὖν δίκην τῶν ἀδίκως πεπρᾱγμένων. = The woman who stole the things of others and at the same time persuaded others to do the same things and who did not perform sacrifices to the gods and who taught young men to do wrong — was she harming the whole city or not?  So let her pay the penalty for the things she has done unjustly.

παρὰ δόξαν δὴ τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἐγένετο τόδε· οὐκ ἐξῆλθον οἱ σύμμαχοι ἐπὶ  τοὺς πολεμίους. ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ μὴ νῑκῷντο. = Contrary to expectation in fact the following thing happened to the Greeks; the allies did not come out against the enemy.  For they were afraid that they might be defeated.

ἐν πόλει τῇ εὖ πολῑτευομένῃ μεταδίδοται ἡ ἀρχή. οἱ γὰρ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἀλλήλων ἄρχουσι καὶ ὑπ’ ἀλλήλων ἄρχονται. = In the well-governed city the rule is shared.  For the same men both rule each other and are ruled by each other.

τούτων γενομένων, οἱ πάσχοντες μαθήσονται. ἡ γὰρ ἐμπειρίᾱ διδάσκει καὶ τοὺς ἄφρονας. = If these things happen, those suffering will learn.  For experience teaches even the foolish.

τὸν Ἀριστοφάνη τῑμώντων μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν Εὐρῑπίδην. = Let them honor Aristophanes rather that Euripides.

εὐδαίμων γενήσεται οὗτος, ᾧ ἂν δῶσιν οἱ θεοὶ λόγων γνώμην καὶ ἔργων ἀρετήν. = He will become happy (fortunate), to whomever the gods give, of speeches, judgment, and of deeds, virtue.  [i.e. judgment in speeches, virtue in deeds]

ἐπὶ τόδ’ ἤλθετ’, ὦ ἄφρονες, ὡς χρῡσοῦ στέφανον τῷ Εὐρῑπίδῃ δοῖτε; τούτῳ δὴ μὴ δῶτε ἆθλον, ἀλλὰ δότε τῷ ἄλλῳ ποιητῇ. = Did you come for this purpose, foolish (people), so that you might give Euripides a crown of gold?  Do not give a prize to him, but give it to another poet.

τὰ τείχη φυλαττέτω τοῖς πολί̄ταις τά τε σώματα καὶ τὰ χρήματα καὶ τὴν ἐλευθερίᾱν. ἄνευ γὰρ τῶν τειχῶν νῑκηθέντες ἢ τελευτήσαιμεν ἂν τὸν βίον ἢ ὑπὸ ξένων δοῦλοι γενοίμεθ’ ἄν. = Let the walls guard for the citizens their bodies, their money and their freedom.  For without the walls, if we should be defeated, we would either end our life or we would become slaves by strangers.

οἳ ἂν ταύτην τὴν πόλιν ἀργύρου ἀποδῶνται, τούτους λίθοις βαλόντων αἱ γυναῖκες μηδὲ εἰσδεχέσθων αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰ̄ς οἰκίᾱς. = Whoever sells this city for silver, let the women pelt them with stones and let (the women) not receive them in their houses.

ἐπειδὴ ἀπέστημεν ἀπὸ βασιλέως, δοίητ’, ὦ θεοί, καὶ κράτος καὶ νί̄κην τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς τῆσδε τῆς ἡμέρᾱς τοῖς πολεμίοις μαχουμένοις. = Since we revolted from the king, would that you give, O gods, both power and victory to the men who are about to fight  the enemy on this day.

ὁ φόνου δίκην φεύγων ταῖς κακῶν ῥητόρων μηχαναῖς οὐκ ἐσῴζετο. φονέᾱς γὰρ οὐκ ἐφίλει ὁ δῆμος. = The man running away from the penalty of murder was not saved by the devices of bad orators.  For the people did not like murderers.

ἅτε κακὰ παθόντες ὑπὸ τῶν πολῑτῶν τῶν ἀεὶ τὰ μὲν ζῷα πάντα καταλαμβανόντων καὶ ἀπαγομένων τὰ̄ς δ’ οἰκίᾱς πά̄σᾱς καταλῡόντων βουλήθητε μάχεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ βλαπτόμενοι εἰρήνην ἄγειν. = Since you have suffered (at the hands of) the citizens who are, on the one hand, always seizing and leading away all your animals, on the other hand, destroying all your houses, wish to fight rather than to keep peace and be harmed.

ἐν οἴνῳ καὶ ὁ σοφὸς ἄφρονα πρά̄ττει. ὁ γὰρ οἶνος καταλύ̄ει τὴν γνώμην. μὴ οὖν τὴν γνώμην καταλύ̄ου, σοφέ. = Even the wise man does foolish things under the influence of (lit. in) wine.  For wine destroys the judgment.  So do not destroy your judgment, wise man.

τῶν ὅπλων καταβληθέντων, καὶ ἄνευ ἀσπίδος μάχου. = Although the weapons have been thrown down, fight even without a shield.

ὅπως ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ γενήσεσθε. = See to it that you become good men in this war.

καὶ τοὺς πόδας καὶ τὰ̄ς χεῖρας οὕτως ἀγαθοὶ οἵδε οἱ στρατιῶται ὥστε καὶ ἄνευ ἀσπίδων καὶ ξιφῶν τοὺς τῶν ἀδίκων ῥητόρων ἑταίρους νενῑκήκᾱσιν. = These soldiers are so good both in respect to their feet and hands that they have defeated the companions of the unjust orators even without shields and swords.

στήτω πρὸ τοῦ ἱεροῦ καὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα τῇ θεῷ ἀναθέτω. = Let him stand before the shrine and dedicate his shield to the goddess.

εἴθε πρὸ τῆς ἑορτῆς τῆς ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ ἱερῷ θύ̄οιεν οἱ ἱερεῖς ὑπὲρ τούτων οἷς οἱ δαίμονες χρῡσὸν οὐκ ἔδοσαν. δότε δὴ ἀγαθὰ αὐτοῖς, ὦ θεοί. = If only the priests would sacrifice before the festival in that shrine on behalf of those men to whom the divinities did not give gold.  Give them, in fact, good things, O gods.

ἅτε εἰληφότες παρὰ τῶν πατέρων τὸ τῆς θαλάττης κράτος, οὐ μαχούμεθα ὑπὲρ τῆς ἀρχῆς; = Since we have taken the power of the sea from our fathers, will we not fight on behalf of the empire?

ἐκεῖνος ὁ αἰσχρὸς ῥήτωρ δῶρα δεξάμενος παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ πείσᾱς τοὺς πολί̄τᾱς εἰρήνην ποιήσασθαι ἀντὶ τοῦ μάχεσθαι ἤθελε τῑμηθῆναι. = That shameful orator after having received gifts from the king and having persuaded the citizens to make peace instead of fighting, wanted to be honored.

ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἔστημεν, τρόπαιον ἐστησάμεθα. = When we stood in the plain we set up a trophy.

τότε μὲν εὖ μαχεσάμενοι καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους νῑκήσαντες ἔπειτα τρόπαιον ἵ̄στατε, ὦ Ἕλληνες. νῦν δὲ καὶπερ οὐκ ἐν μάχῃ νῑκηθέντες, τοῖς βαρβάροις ὅμως πείθεσθε τὴν ἐλευθερίᾱν χρημάτων χάριν ἀποβάλλοντες. = O Greeks, having fought well then and defeated the enemy you were thereupon setting up a trophy.  But now, although you are not defeated in battle, you nevertheless obey the barbarians and throw away your freedom for the sake of money.

ὅτε ἄργυρον τῷ ἄρχοντι ἐδίδου, τρόπαιον ἵ̄σταμεν. = When you used to give silver to the ruler, we used to set up a trophy.

Although being harmed, let the citizens neither dissolve the democracy nor appoint a king to rule the city. = καίπερ βλαπτόμενοι, μήτε λύσαντων οἱ πολῖται τὴν δημοκρατίαν μήτε καθιστάντων βασιλέα ὡς τῆς πόλεως ἄρξοντα.

That ancient king made good laws for the citizens: he contrived you know that being willing to fight on behalf of their children they would save the city. = ἐκεῖνος ὁ παλαιὸς βασιλεὺς τοῖς πολίταις ἀγαθοὺς νόμους ἔθηκεν. ἐμηχανήσατό τοι ὅπως ἐθέλοντες μαχέσθαι ὕπερ τῶν παίδων σώσουσι τὴν πόλιν.

If you (pl.) had not given this gold to the shameful woman, she would have fled at some time to the same island with the murderer of the seven dancers. = εἰ οὐκ ἔδοτε τοῦτον τὸν χρυσὸν τῇ αἰσχρᾷ γυναικί, ἔφυγεν ἄν ποτε εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν νῆσον μετὰ τοῦ φονέως (τοῦ) τῶν ἕπτα χορευτῶν.

After he came out of the house Euripides fled with his companions to another house. For his mother feared that we would hit him with stones. = ἔλθων ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας, ἔφυγεν ὁ Εὐριπίδης μετὰ τῶν ἑταίρων πρὸς τὴν ἀλλὴν οἰκίαν. ἐφοβήθη γὰρ ἡ μήτηρ μὴ τοῖς λιθοῖς αὐτὸν βάλοιμεν.

It is difficult to revolt from the city: having thrown away our weapons, how are we to fight soldiers experienced in war? = χαλεπὸς ἀφιστάσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως. ἀποβάλοντες τῶν ὅπλων, πῶς μαχώμεθα στρατιώτας ἐμπείρους πολέμου.
