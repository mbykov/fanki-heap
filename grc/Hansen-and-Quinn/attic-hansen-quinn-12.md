πόθεν κατεπέμφθης εἰς ταύτην γε τὴν πόλιν ὅπως τοῖς ἐννέα καλοῖς γραφεῦσι, τοῖς τῶν θεῶν ἑρμηνεῦσι, δῶρά πως διδοίης αὐτή; τῇ γὰρ γραφικῇ τὴν τῆς ἀρετῆς φύσιν τοῖς νεᾱνίαις ἀληθῶς που δεδηλώκᾱσιν οὗτοι. δικαίως οὖν τῑμηθέντων ὑπὸ πάντων. = From where were you sent into this city in order that you yourself might somehow give gifts to the nine noble writers, the interpreters of the gods? For by (the art of) writing they have, I suppose, truly made clear the nature of virtue to the young men. So let them justly be honored by everyone.

πῶς μόνη διδαχθῶ πρὸς τῇ ῥητορικῇ τὴν γραφικὴν ὑπὸ τοῦδε τοῦ αἰσχροῦ ζωγράφου τοῦ θυσίᾱς οὐδὲ ταῖς μούσαις ἀγαγόντος ποτέ; = How am I alone to be taught, in addition to rhetoric, (the art of) painting (writing) by this shameful painter who has never even sacrificed to the muses?

καὶ ὁ Ὅμηρος καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης γραφῆς ὑπὸ πάντων που τῑμώμενοι, ἀλλὰ ῥήτωρ μὲν οὗτος, ἐκεῖνος δὲ ποιητής. τῑμά̄τω αὐτοὺς ὅ γε δῆμος. = Both Homer and Demosthenes are writers who are honored, I suppose, by everyone, but while the latter is an orator, the former is a poet. Let the people, at any rate, honor them.

δίδαξαι τὸν ἀδελφόν γε τὴν γραφικήν. ἄνευ γὰρ ταύτης τῆς τέχνης οὔτε γράφεταί ποτε καλὰ βιβλία ὑπ’ ἀνδρῶν τῶν γραφέων καλουμένων οὔτε καλῶς ἀκούουσιν οὗτοι ὑπό γε τῶν σοφῶν. = Teach your brother, at least, (the art of) writing. For without this art neither are beautiful books ever written by men called writers, nor are they spoken of well (nobly) by the wise.

πρὸς τῶν ἀθανάτων μὴ φιλεῖτε τούς γε δέκα οἵ δῶρ’ ἐδίδοσαν τοῖς ἐν τέλει εἰσάξοντες εἰς τὴν γῆν τοὺς πολεμίους. ἀλλὰ τῑμήσατε δὴ Δημοσθένη ἅτε τὴν πόλιν σώσαντα. = By the Immortals, do not love the ten (men) at least who were giving bribes to those in office in order to lead the enemy into the land. But honor, in fact, Demosthenes since he (has) saved the city.

ἐπειδὴ μόνοι οἱ θεοὶ τὰ καλὰ διδόᾱσι τὴν πόλιν σῴζοντες, τούς γε θεοὺς φοβούμενος πείθου μᾶλλον τοῖς νόμοις οὓς ἐκεῖνοι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τιθέᾱσιν ἢ τούτοις οὓς οἱ ἄνθρωποί πως τίθενται. = Since the gods alone, saving the city, give the noble things, fear the gods and obey the laws which they set down (make) for men rather than those which men somehow set down (make) for themselves.

καλός τοι δημιουργὸς ἐκεῖνος ὁ θεὸς ὁ τήν τε γῆν καὶ τὰ ζῷα καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οὕτως εὖ πεποιηκώς. = A fine craftsman indeed is that god, the one who has made both the earth and the animals and mankind so well.

δημιουργὸς τῆς πόλεως καλείσθω οὗτος ὃς ἂν δικαίως τοὺς νόμους τοῖς πολί̄ταις τιθῇ. = Let him be called a craftsman of the city whoever justly sets down (makes) laws for the citizens.

ἐτίθει μὲν ὁ βασιλεὺς νόμους τοῖς ἀρχομένοις, τίθενται δὲ νῦν νόμους ἔν γε ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις οἱ πολῖται οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἐλευθέραις πόλεσι πολῑτευόμενοι. = The king used to make laws for his subjects (those being ruled), but now the citizens who are governed in free cities make laws in (their) assemblies.

τῆς γε πρώτης ἡμέρᾱς συνῑστάμεθά που ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾱͅ τοὺς τοῦ σοφοῦ Σωκράτους λόγους τοὺς περὶ τῆς ἀνθρώπου φύσεως ἀκουσόμενοι. = During the first day we were standing together somewhere in the house in order to hear the speeches of wise Socrates about the nature of man.

αἰσχροὶ δὴ καὶ ἄξιοι τοῖς πολί̄ταις θανάτου πάντες οὗτοι οἱ κακοὶ ῥήτορες οἳ ἂν δῶρα λαβόντες τὴν πόλιν τῷ τῶν βαρβάρων βασιλεῖ χρῡσοῦ ἢ ἀργύρου ἀποδιδῶνται. μὴ οὖν ἀποδιδόσθων τὰ̄ς πάντων οἰκίᾱς. = Shameful, in fact, and worthy of death by the citizens are all those bad orators, whoever, having taken bribes, sells the city to the king of the barbarians for gold or silver. So do not let them sell everyone’s houses.

οὐκ ἂν ἀποδιδοῖτό ποθ’ ὅ γε σοφὸς τὴν ἀρετὴν χρῡσοῦ. ὁ γὰρ χρῡσὸς οὐκ ἀεὶ μενεῖ, ἀλλ’ ἀθάνατος ἡ τῆς ἀρετῆς δόξα. = The wise man, at least, would never sell virtue for gold. For gold does not always endure (stay), but the reputation of virtue is immortal.

πόθεν ἥξουσιν οἱ πολέμιοι; ποῦ ταξώμεθα οἱ ὁπλῖται; ποῖ βούλεσθ’ ἐξαγαγεῖν τοὺς ἱππέᾱς; πῶς ἂν ἐκσωθείη ἐκ κινδύ̄νων ἡ πόλις καὶ καλῶς ἀκούσαι; νί̄κην διδοίησάν πως ἀεὶ οἱ θεοὶ τοῖς γε κακὰ παθοῦσιν. ἔπειτα ἱστάσθων τὰ ὅπλα ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ οἱ νῑκήσαντες. = From where will the enemy come? Where are we hoplites to fall into battle order? To where do you wish to lead out the horsemen? How might the city be delivered (saved) from dangers and be spoken of nobly? If only the gods always somehow give victory to those who (have) suffered bad things. Let the victors then stand their weapons in the temple.

ἄδηλοι δὴ οἱ λόγοι οὓς τοῦ βαρβάρου ἑρμηνέως ἐν τῇ βουλῇ ἠκούσαμεν, ἀλλὰ φοβούμεθα μὴ οὐ τελευτᾷ ὁ πόλεμος. = The speeches which we heard in the council from the barbarian interpreter are in fact unclear, but we are afraid that the war is not over (finished, ended).

ἐὰ̄ν μὴ κωλύ̄σῃς ποτὲ τὸν ἀδικοῦντα, μὴ ἐκείνῳ γε συναδικήσῃς, ὦ ῥῆτορ, ἀλλὰ πείθου τοῖς τῆς πόλεως νόμοις. = If you do not ever prevent the wrongdoer, orator, do not do wrong (together) with him, but obey the laws of the city.

ἀληθεῖς τοι φίλοι οἱ τῇ ἀληθείᾱͅ ἀλλήλους φιλοῦντες, ἀλλ’ οὔτοι φίλοι οἳ ἂν φοβῶνται μὴ ὑπ’ ἀλλήλων βλαφθῶσιν. = Those who in truth [truly] love one another are true friends, you know, but those who are afraid that they may be harmed by one another are indeed not friends.

ὅτε γε συνισταῖντο πρὸς ἀλλήλας αἱ τῶν Ἑλλήνων πόλεις, τότε δὴ συνήρχομεν τῶν βαρβάρων. νῦν δὲ ἀλλήλους ἀντ’ ἐκείνων βλάπτομεν ὥστε τούς γε σοφοὺς φοβηθῆναι μὴ ὑπ’ ἐκείνων ἀρχώμεθα αὐτοί. = Whenever the cities of the Greeks stood together [for] each other, we used to rule together, in fact, the barbarians then. But now we are hurting each other instead of them so as for the wise to fear that we ourselves may be ruled by them.

οὐκ ἀπεδέξατό που ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς τοῦ ἱερέως λόγους τοὺς περὶ τοῦ τὴν θυγατέρα τυθῆναι. ταύτην γὰρ φιλῶν ὁ πατὴρ οὐκ ἠξίου τελευτᾶν. = The king did not welcome (accept), I suppose, the words (speeches) of the priest about the sacrificing of his daughter. For since the father loved her, he did not think [she] deserved to die.

ἀγαθόν γε τὸ τὸν ἄδικον δίκην διδόναι ἁπάντων τῶν κακῶς πεπρᾱγμένων. = It is good for the wrongdoer (unjust man) to pay the penalty for all the bad things that he has done.

ποῖ τοὺς δέκα κήρῡκας ἐξαγάγωμεν πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους ἀπαγγελοῦντας τάδε· καίπερ τὴν εἰρήνην φιλοῦντες μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν πόλεμον, ἐά̄ν γε τὴν πόλιν πρῶτοι ἀδικῆτε, καταλύ̄σομεν τὴν εἰρήνην ἅτε βλαπτόμενοι; = To where are we to lead out the ten heralds in order to announce to the barbarians the following: although we love peace rather than war, if you wrong the [our] city first, we shall destroy the peace since we are being harmed.

ταῦτα τὰ ὅπλα θεοῖς τοῖς σωτῆρσι ἀνατίθησι βασιλεὺς ἐν μάχῃ νῑκήσᾱς. = A king is dedicating these weapons to the savior gods after having won in battle.

καθίστη πως εἰς τὴν ἀρχὴν τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς καὶ σοφοὺς καλουμένους. = He was somehow appointing the good and the men called wise into the rule.

τοὺς πολί̄τᾱς ἐβουλήθην ἀποστῆσαι ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀθηναίων ἀρχῆς, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνοι φοβηθέντες οὔτ’ ἀφί̄σταντό ποτ’ οὔτε ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐλευθερίᾱς λόγους γ’ ἐποιοῦντο. = I wanted the citizens to revolt from the Athenian empire (rule), but since they were afraid, they neither revolted ever nor did they make speeches on behalf of freedom.

ἄλλῳ τοι ἄλλην τέχνην ἐδίδου ὁ θεός· τῷ μὲν γὰρ Ὁμήρῳ καὶ τοῖς τὰ ἔπη ποιοῦσι τὴν ποιητικήν, τῷ δὲ Δημοσθένει καὶ ἄλλοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾱͅ τοὺς πολί̄τᾱς λόγοις πείθουσι τὴν ῥητορικήν. = The god gave a different art to different men, you know. For to Homer and to those who make verses [he gave] (the art of ) poetics, while to Demosthenes and to others who persuade the the citizens with speeches in the assembly [he gave] rhetoric.

When we heard the messenger in the assembly, we feared that the heavy-armed foot-soldiers would not lead the women down to the sea. = ὅτε ἠκούσαμεν τοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀγγέλου, ἐφοβούμεθα μὴ οἱ ὁπλῖται οὐκ ἄγοιεν τὰς γυναῖκας κατὰ τὴν θάλατταν.

Do not fear that the gods will not always give sufficient things to men. = μὴ φοβοῦ (φοβεῖσθε) μὴ οἱ θεοὶ οὐκ ἀεὶ διδῶσιν ἱκανὰ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις.

I am afraid that the bad king always made unjust laws somehow for the men in the cities. = φοβοῦμαι μὴ ὁ κακὸς βασιλεὺς ἀδικοὺς νόμους ἀεὶ ἔθηκέ πως τοῖς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν.

Let the men in the market place somehow give either gold or silver to the soldiers whom we are causing to revolt. = διδόντων πως οἱ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ἢ χρυσὸν ἢ ἄργυρον τοῖς στρατιώταις οὓς ἀφίσταμεν.

Let us always put books in the house of the public speaker in order that he may teach his brother the epic poetry composed (made) by Homer. = τιθῶμεν ἀεὶ βιβλία ἐν τῇ τοῦ ῥήτορος οἰκίᾳ ὅπως διδάσκῃ τὸν ἀδελφὸν τὰ ἔπη τὰ ποιούμενα τῷ Ὁμήρῳ.
