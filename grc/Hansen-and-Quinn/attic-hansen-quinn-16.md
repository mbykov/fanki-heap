ἔλεγέν τις πονηρὸς ὅτι αὐτός γε, καίπερ ἐν τῇ τότε στάσει ἐκπεσὼν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, οὐκ ἐκπεσοῖτο ὑπὸ τῶν νῦν ἀρχόντων· δῶρα γάρ τινα λαμβάνοιεν ἄν. = A certain base man was saying that although he had been banished from the city in the civil strife at that time, he at least would not be banished by the rulers today; for they would take certain bribes.

Πάνυ γε· λέγεις γάρ που ὅτι πᾶσι μὲν ἔξεστι καλῶς πρά̄ττειν, πολλοὶ δὲ διὰ τὴν αὑτῶν ἀμαθίᾱν πρά̄ττουσι κακῶς. = Certainly. For you are saying, I suppose, that while it is possible for everyone to act nobly, many do bad things on account of their ignorance.

Εὖ γε· τίνα δὴ τρόπον γένοιντ’ ἂν οὗτοι εὐδαίμονες; = Well done. In what way, in fact, could the latter become happy?

ὑ̄μεῖς αὐτοί, ὦ ῥήτορες, ἐδείκνυθ’ ὅτι δημοκρατίᾱ μὲν ἀγαθὴ εἴη πολῑτείᾱ, βασιλέων δὲ τῶν παλαιῶν πολλοὶ οὔτε κακῶς οὔτε πονηρῶς τοῦ δήμου ἄρξαιεν. = You yourselves, orators, used to show that while democracy is a good regime, many of the ancient kings ruled the people neither badly nor basely.

By the gods, you at least used to say, Athenian men, that all the Greeks would conquer the foreigners and set up a trophy. = νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς ὑμεῖς γ’ ἐλέγετε, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, ὅτι πάντες οἱ Ἕλληνες τοὺς ξένους νικήσοιεν καὶ τρόπαιον ἀναθησεῖεν.
