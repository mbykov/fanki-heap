ἄρξομαι μέν, ὦ ἄνδρες, τὴν Δημοσθένους ἀμαθίᾱν περὶ τῶν κοινῶν τῆς πόλεως πρᾱγμάτων δεικνῦσα, ἔπειτα δὲ πάντα δηλώσω τὰ τοῖς γ’ ἄλλοις ῥήτορσι ἀδίκως πεπρᾱγμένα. = I will begin, men, on the one hand, by showing the ignorance of Demosthenes about the common affairs of the city, then, on the other hand, I will make clear all the things that have been done unjustly by the other orators.

τρόπαιον ἱστάντων τῶν στρατιωτῶν, ὁ στρατηγὸς ἀποπεμψάτω εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἐννέα κήρῡκας τὴν νί̄κην ἀπαγγελοῦντας. = Since the soldiers are setting up a trophy, let the general send away nine heralds into the city in order to report the victory.

μετάδοτέ ποτε τῆς ἀρχῆς καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ στάσει φυγοῦσιν. = Give a share of the rule some time even to those fleeing in the civil strife.

ὦ φίλοι, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως αὐτίκα φυγόντες πῶς λάθοιτ’ ἂν τούσδε γε τοὺς φύλακας τοὺς ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει ἑστῶτας; = Friends, if you (should) run away from the city at once, how would you escape the notice of these guards (who have been) standing on the wall?

ὅταν ἕτεροι ἑτέρων ἀξιῶσιν ἄρχειν, οἱ ἀρχόμενοι ἀεὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἐπαναστήναι βούλονται. νόμῳ μὲν γάρ τοι καλὸν καὶ δίκαιον τὸ ἄλλων ὑπακούειν, φύσει δὲ κακὸν καὶ αἰσχρὸν τὸ ἄφροσιν ἀνθρώποις δουλεύειν. = Whenever some think [themselves] worthy to rule others, the (ones being) ruled always want to rise up against those ruling.  For obeying others is noble and just, you know, by convention, while being a slave to foolish people is bad and shameful by nature.

τοῦ δήμου ἐπαναστάντος, ὁ βασιλεύς, παραδοὺς τῷ παιδὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ ἐκφυγὼν ἐκ τῆς χώρᾱς, ἔλαθέ πως τοὺς πολί̄τᾱς ἐλθὼν εἰς ἄλλην χώρᾱν ὡς ἐκεῖ παραμενῶν καὶ τελευτήσων τὸν βίον. = After the people revolted, the king, having handed over the rule to his son and having fled from the land, without somehow the citizens noticing, went to another land in order to stay and end his life there.

ἔτυχεν ὁ Δημοσθένης ἐπιδεικνύμενος ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ τὴν ῥητορικὴν ὅτ’ εἰσῆλθον κήρῡκες ἀγγελοῦντες τὴν πάντων τῶν βαρβάρων νί̄κην. = Demosthenes happened to be displaying his rhetoric in the market place when heralds entered intending to announce the victory of all the barbarians.

ἄξιος δὴ κακὰ παθεῖν οὗτος ὁ τούς τε νόμους καὶ τὴν δημοκρατίᾱν καταλύ̄σᾱς καὶ τὴν πόλιν εἰς στάσιν καθιστά̄ς. = This man who has destroyed both the democracy and the laws, and who has put the city into a state of civil strife, deserves in fact to suffer bad things.

ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, καὶ τούτους τοὺς κινδύ̄νους ὑπομείνατε ὑπὲρ τῆς πάντων ἐλευθερίᾱς μαχόμενοι. = Men of Athens, endure even these dangers and fight on behalf of everyone’s freedom.

προσελθόντος τοῦ Εὐρῑπίδου, ἐτύγχανόν που αἱ παῖδες αἱ εὐγενεῖς τῇ θεῷ χορεύουσαι. = When Euripides approached, the well-born girls happened, I suppose, to be dancing to the goddess.

τῇ μὲν ἑτέρᾱͅ χειρὶ ἀσπίδα λαβοῦσα, τῇ δ’ ἑτέρᾱͅ ξίφος, ὦ μῆτερ Εὐρῑπίδου, ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς οἰκίᾱς μαχουμένη δὴ πά̄σαις ταῖς ἄλλαις γυναιξίν. = Taking a shield in one hand, a sword in the other, mother of Euripides, go out of the house in order to fight in fact all the other women.

ὦ παῖδες, ἐὰ̄ν οἱ πολέμιοι φθάσωσι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους εἰς μέσην γε τὴν πόλιν εἰσελθόντες, ἐνταῦθ’ οὐκέτι παραμενοῦμεν. οὐ γάρ τοι ῥᾴ̄διον τὸ βαρβάρων ὑπακούειν. = Children, if the enemy enters the city center before the Athenians, we will no longer stay here.  For obeying barbarians is not easy you know.

ἀεί που χαίρουσιν οἱ ἄδικοι τοὺς ψῡχήν γ’ ἀγαθοὺς κακὰ ποιοῦντες. = Unjust men always rejoice, I suppose, in doing bad things to men who are good in (respect of) their soul.

ἐκείνου τοῦ διδασκάλου μὴ παιδεύοντος τοὺς μαθητὰ̄ς περὶ ἀρετῆς καταλυθήσεται ἡ δημοκρατίᾱ. = If that teacher does not educate the students about virtue, the democracy will be (utterly) destroyed.

νῑκηθέντων τῶν πολεμίων, τὴν ἑορτὴν τῷ θεῷ ὅμως οὐκ ἐποιούμεθα φοβούμενοι μὴ ἔτι λάθοιεν τοὺς στρατιώτᾱς καὶ ἄλλοι ἱππεῖς εἰς τὴν χώρᾱν εἰσελθόντες. = Although the enemy was defeated, we were nevertheless not making a festival to the god since we were afraid that even other horsemen might still come into the land without the (our) soldiers noticing.

ἐρώτησον τὸν Σωκράτη περὶ τῆς νῦν γε στάσεως. ἕστηκε γὰρ ἐν μέσῃ τῇ ἀγορᾷ. = Ask Socrates about the present civil strife.  For he has been (is) standing in the middle of the market place.

πάντων τῶν ἄλλων εἰρήνην πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόντων, ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸς παυσάτω μαχομένους τοὺς ὁπλί̄τᾱς. = Since all the others are keeping peace with each other, let the general of the Athenians stop the hoplites (from) fighting.

εἰ μὴ τοὺς παῖδας παιδεύσαι ὁ ἀδελφός, παίδευσαι αὐτὸν παιδεῦσαι αὐτούς. = If (your) brother should not teach his boys, have him taught to teach them.

οἱ ῥήτορες, χρῡσὸν παρὰ τῶν πολεμίων λαβόντες, ἔπειθον τὸν δῆμον ἐκβαλεῖν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως οὐ μόνον τοὺς ἠδικηκότας ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς εὖ τε καὶ σωφρόνως πεπολῑτευμένους καὶ ὑπὲρ πάντων μεμαχημένους. = After having taken gold from the enemy, the orators were persuading the people to throw out of the city not only those who had done wrong, but also those who had governed both well and prudently and who had fought on behalf of everyone.

οἳ ἂν χαίρωσιν τοὺς ἄνδρας ἀδικοῦντες, αὐτοὶ δικαίως ὑπὸ τούτων πείσονταί ποτε δεινά. = Those who enjoy wronging men will themselves justly suffer at some time terrible things by them.

μηχανωμένων τῶν ἑταίρων ὅπως Σωκράτη ἐκλύ̄σονται, ἕσταμέν που πρὸς τῷ τείχει. = Since the companions are contriving that they will free Socrates, we are standing somewhere near the wall.

οἱ πάλαι ῥᾱͅδίως τὴν γῆν ἀπολιπόντες εἰς ἄλλᾱς χώρᾱς μετανί̄σταντο, οὐδὲ Ἕλληνες οἱ πάντες ἐκαλοῦντο. = Having abandoned the land, the ancients used to migrate easily to other lands, and they were all not even called Greek.

νῦν δὴ ἐπιδείκνυσο τήν γε ῥητορικήν, ἀγαθὲ νεᾱνίᾱ. τοὺς γὰρ ἄλλους μαθητὰ̄ς ἔφθης ἐρωτήσᾱς τὸν διδάσκαλον περὶ ἀρετῆς. = Display now, in fact, your rhetoric, good youth.  For you beat the other students in asking the teacher about virtue.

ἐπίδειξιν ποιούμενοι τυγχάνουσιν οἱ ῥήτορες. = The orators happen to be doing a demonstration.

ὦ νέοι, μήτ’ ἐκκλέψητ’ οἶνον ἐξ ἐκείνης γε τῆς οἰκίᾱς μήτε τὰ̄ς γυναῖκας βλάψητε. = Young men, neither steal wine from that house nor harm the women.

κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων. = The things of friends are (in) common.

ἆρ’ οὐκ ἐπαύσασθε μαχόμενοι; νῦν γε παύσασθε, ὦ ἀμαθεῖς. = Did you not cease from fighting?  Cease now, you ignoramuses.

ὦ αἰσχρὲ ῥήτορ, τόν γε δῆμον οὐ λανθάνεις δῶρα λαμβάνων. = You shameful orator, your taking bribes is not unnoticed by the people at least.

ὁ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς χαίρων ἀγαθῶν γε τεύξεται. = The man who rejoices in good things will obtain good things.

Although the king wishes somehow to hand the city over to the enemies, the young men will obey the generals and remain in the middle of the plain in order to fight on behalf of the people. = καίπερ ἐθέλει ὁ βασιλεὺς παραδιδόναι πως τὴν πόλιν τοῖς πολεμίοις, οἱ νεανίαι πείσονται τοῖς στρατηγοῖς καὶ μενοῦσιν ἐν μέσῳ τῷ πεδίῳ ὡς μαχούμενοι ὑπὲρ τοῦ δήμου.

I happened to hear the speakers asking the messengers about the horsemen being sent into this land. = ἔτυχον ἄκουσας τῶν ῥητόρων ἐρωτώντων τοὺς ἀγγέλους περὶ τῶν ἱππέων πεμφθέντων εἰς ταύτην τὴν χώραν.

Because the priests made sacrifices to all the gods, the enemy, conquered in battle, fled in silence during that night without the hoplites’ noticing. = θυσιῶν ἀγαγόντων τῶν ἱερέων πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς, οἱ πολεμίοι, νικήθεντες ἐν μάχῃ, ἐκείνης τῆς νυκτὸς ἐν σιγῇ φεύγοντες τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἔλαθον.

We enjoy hearing Socrates, at least, teaching the citizens about virtue. = χαίρομεν ἀκούοντες τοῦ γε Σωκράτους διδάσκοντος τοὺς πολίτας περὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς.

When the soldiers come into the city, flee! = ἐρχομένων τῶν στρατιώτων εἰς τὴν πόλιν, φύγετε.
