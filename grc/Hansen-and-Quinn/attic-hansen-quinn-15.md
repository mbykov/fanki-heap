ἄφρων που ὃς ἂν μὴ λάβῃ ἀγαθόν τι διδόμενον παρὰ τῶν φίλων. = Surely, foolish is he who, when given something good from his friends, does not take it.

αἰσχρόν τι ποιήσᾱς ἄλλους μὲν λάθοις ἄν, σεαυτὸν δὲ οὔ. μὴ οὖν ποίει τοιοῦτο. = You might do a shameful thing unnoticed by others, but not by yourself.  So do not do such a thing.

τί σὺ ποιήσεις τὴν πόλιν ἑλών; τί ἐμὲ ἐρωτᾷς; ὁ γὰρ στρατηγός γε ἡμᾶς ἂν κελεύσειεν ἢ τὰ̄ς οἰκίᾱς φυλάττειν ἢ χρήματά τε καὶ ζῷα καταλαβεῖν. = What will you do after you have captured the city?  Why are you asking me?  For the general might order us either to guard the houses or to seize both money and animals.

τοιοῦτος ἦν ὁ Σωκράτης ὥστε πάντας τοὺς σοφούς τε καὶ σώφρονας αὐτὸν τῑμᾶν. τοῖς γὰρ νόμοις εἵπετο, τοῖς δὲ θεοῖς θυσίᾱς ἦγε καὶ τοὺς πολί̄τᾱς περὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἠρώτᾱ. = Socrates was of such a sort as for all the wise and prudent to honor him.  For he used to follow the laws, perform sacrifices to the gods and question (ask) the citizens about virtue?

ἀντὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς τε καὶ τῑμῆς χρήματά γε ᾑροῦντο οἱ ἄφρονες. τί οὐχ οἷόσ τ’ ἦν ὁ Σωκράτης τούτους πεῖσαι ἀγαθόν τι ἑλέσθαι; σύ γε, φίλε, ἑλοῦ τὰ τοιαῦτα. = Instead of virtue and honor, foolish men used to choose money.  Why was Socrates not able to persuade them to choose something good?  You, at least, friend, choose things of this sort.

ὦ παῖ, ἴσθι τῷ ὄντι τοιοῦτος οἷος ἦν ὁ πατήρ. = (My) boy, be really (truly) of such a sort as your father was.

ὁ νεᾱνίᾱς ὁ καλός τε καὶ ἀμαθὴς αὑτὸν ἐν ὕδατί τινι ἰδὼν αὑτόν γε ἐφίλησεν οὐδ’ οἷός τ’ ἦν ἀπελθεῖν. μετὰ δὲ πέντε ἡμέρᾱς ἐτελεύτησε διὰ τὸν αὑτοῦ ἔρωτα. τρόπον δή τινα τελευτῶσι πάντες οἱ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς φιλοῦντες. = The handsome and ignorant young man fell in love with himself when he saw himself in some water and was not able to go away.  After five days he died on account of his love himself.  All who love themselves die in some manner in fact.

οἷον δὴ πάντες τῑμῶσιν, τὸν τὴν πόλιν σώσαντα στρατηγόν, τοιοῦτοι γενώμεθα. = Let us become of such a sort as everyone in fact honors, (such as) the general who has saved the city.

τοιαῦτα ἆθλα νί̄κης ἡμῖν εἴη ἀεί, οἷα οἱ πατέρες ἠνέγκοντο. = If only we would always have the sort of victory prizes as our fathers won.

ἐπειδήπερ ἑσπόμεθα ἡμεῖς τῷ Σωκράτει εἰς τὴν ἀγορά̄ν, ἠκούσαμεν αὐτοῦ τοὺς δημιουργοὺς καὶ τοὺς ποιητὰ̄ς ἐρωτῶντος περὶ τῶν τεχνῶν. = After we followed Socrates into the market, we heard him asking the craftsmen and the poets about the arts.

ὦ θύγατέρ μου, ἐά̄ν σοι αἰσχρός τις γέρων ἐξ ἀγορᾶς σπῆται, μὴ φοβηθῇς. φυλαττουσῶν γὰρ πᾱσῶν τῶν θεῶν τὰ̄ς νέᾱς, οὔ σε βλάψειεν ἄν. = My daughter, if some shameful old man follows you out of the market place, do not be afraid.  For since all the gods guard young girls, he could not harm you.

τόν γε κλέψαντα τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἔξεστι τῷ βουλομένῳ καλέσαι εἰς δίκην. Δημοσθένη οὖν γράψαι, ὦ ῥήτορ. = It is possible (allowed) for the man who wants to call to justice the man who has stolen the things of the gods.  Indict Demosthenes, then, orator.

τῇ ἀληθείᾱͅ ἄφρων ὅσπερ ἂν ἑαυτοῦ μὴ ἄρχων βούληται ἄλλων ἄρχειν. = Truly foolish is he who, not ruling himself, wants to rule others.

οἵ γε διδάσκαλοι καίπερ αἰσθανόμενοι τὴν τῶν πολῑτῶν ἀμαθίᾱν οὐχ οἷοί τ’ ἔσονται αὐτοὺς ἐκδιδάξαι. = The teachers, at least, although perceiving the ignorance of the citizens, will not be able to teach them.

διαπέμψωμεν οὖν τοὺς ἡμετέρους δούλους εἰς τὴν πόλιν σου ἀπαγγελοῦντας τοῖς σοῖς τὰ νέα. = Let us send, therefore, our slaves to your city in order to announce the news to your people.

ἔγωγε μὲν οὐκ ἀξιῶ τῑμῆς τοὺς ἆθλα μὴ ἐνεγκομένους· οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἀφρόνως ἐθελόντων τούτους τῑμᾶν. = I, at least, do not think those who have not won prizes worthy of honor; on the other hand, let the others foolishly want to honor them.

παρὰ δέ γε τὴν ἐμὴν γνώμην οὐχ ᾑρέθην ἄρχων. οἱ γὰρ ἀμαθεῖς ἀεί που τοὺς ἀναξίους αἱροῦνται. = Contrary, at least, to my judgment, I was not chosen a ruler.  For the ignorant always, I suppose, choose the unworthy.

τί, ὦ Σώκρατες, γέγονεν ὥστε εἶ ἐνταῦθα; οὐ γάρ που καὶ σοί γε δίκη τις οὖσα τυγχάνει; = What has happened, Socrates, that you are here?  For surely you do not happen to have some lawsuit?

φίλην τινὰ ἰδοῦσα ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐπαύσατο τῇ μητρὶ ἑπομένη. = When she saw some friend in the road, she stopped following her mother.

καὶ ἐγώ τοι μαθητὴς βουλοίμην ἂν γενέσθαι σός. σὺ γὰρ μόνος οἷός τ’ εἶ μοι δεικνύναι τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς ἀρετὴν φέρουσαν. = I, too, you know, would want to become your student.  For you alone are able to show me the path leading to virtue.

οἱ ἐκ τῆς χώρᾱς ξίφη τε καὶ ἀσπίδας φέροντες εἰς τὴν πόλιν ὤφθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν φυλάκων τῶν πρὸ τῶν τειχῶν τεταγμένων. = The men who were carrying swords and shields out of the country into the city were seen by the guards who were stationed in front of the walls.

ἐγώ τοι τὸν ἀδελφόν σου οὔ με ἰδόντα ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ εἶδον. = I, you know, in the market place saw your brother, who did not see me.

τί δὴ φέρων εἰς τὴν ἡμετέρᾱν οἰκίᾱν ἥξεις; ἡμῖν γὰρ ἱκανά ἐστι. = What, in fact, will you come bringing into our house?  For we have enough.

διαφέρει πως τῇ σοφίᾱͅ ὁ Εὐρῑπίδης τῶν ἄλλων ποιητῶν. τοῦτον γὰρ ἡ μοῦσα αὐτὴ ἐξεδίδασκε δείξοντα ἡμῖν τοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων τρόπους. ἄκουσον οὖν τούτου λόγον τινά. = Euripides somehow surpasses in wisdom the other poets.  For the Muse herself used to teach him in order to show us the characters of human beings.  Hear, then, some tale (speech) of his.

ἔστι νεᾱνίᾱς τις ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ πρὸ τῆς οἰκίᾱς βουλόμενός σέ τι ἐρωτῆσαι. ἐρωτῶ οὖν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ. = There is a certain young man in the road in front of the house who wants to ask you something.  So be asked by him.

οὐκ ἀεί που συμφέρει τοὺς νεᾱνίᾱς τὴν ῥητορικὴν διδάξασθαι. οὗτοι γάρ ποτε κακά τινα πρά̄ξαντες οἷοί τ’ εἰσὶν ἡμᾶς πεῖσαι μὴ δίκην λαβεῖν. = It is surely not always useful to teach young men rhetoric.  For if ever they do something bad, they are able to persuade us not to take a punishment.

σοί τοι δηλώσω τὰ ἡμῖν συμφέροντα ἐκείνην τὴν πόλιν ἑλοῦσιν. τῶν γὰρ συμφερόντων δηλωθέντων, ἔπειτα πάντες βουλήσονται μαχέσασθαι. = I will, you know, show you the benefits for us in capturing that city.  For when the benefits have been shown, thereupon everyone will want to fight.

τοὺς δὲ λίθους διενέγκωμεν διὰ τοῦ πεδίου περιβαλούμενοι τεῖχος τῇ πόλει. = Let us carry the stones through the plain in order to encompass a wall around the city.

οἷα δὴ ποιεῖ τις, τοιαῦτα καὶ πείσεται ὑφ’ ἡμῶν. = Whatever kinds of things in fact anyone does, such things also will he suffer from us.

ἆρ’ οὐ σώφρονές ἐστε; σώφρονες ἔστε. = Are you not wise?  Be wise.

τοιούτων ὄντων τῶν πρᾱγμάτων ἡμῖν, ἀγαθοὶ ὄντων οἵ γε ῥήτορες. = Since we have business of such a sort, let the orators be good.

You, although wronged by the strangers, nevertheless wish to keep peace.  But if those men come into our land, fight on behalf of our freedom. = καίπερ ἀδικηθέντες ὑπὸ τῶν ξένων, ὅμως ἐθέλετε εἰρήνην ἄγειν.  ἀλλὰ ἐὰν ἐκεῖνοι ἔλθωσιν εἰς τὴν ἡμετέραν χώραν, μάχεσθε ὑπὲρ τῆς (ἡμετέρας) ἐλευθερίας.

The man who harms others really harms himself; for when harming others he himself becomes bad so that he is not honored by his companions. = ὃς ἂν τοὺς ἄλλους βλάπτῃ ἑαυτὸν δὴ τῷ ὄντι βλάπτει.  βλάπτων γὰρ τοὺς ἄλλους αὐτὸς κακὸς γίγνεται ὥστε μὴ τιμηθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν ἑταίρων.

In what way can anyone now teach others virtue?  Not even Socrates, who excelled all men in virtue, was able to do this. = τίνα τρόπον οἷός τ΄ ἐστί τις νῦν ἄλλους διδάσκειν τὴν ἀρετήν; οὐδέ γε Σωκράτης, ὃς διαφέρει πάντων (τῶν ἀνθρώπων) τὴν ἀρετήν, οἷός τ΄ ἦν τοῦτο ποιεῖν.

These battles are the sort which all the soldiers fear. = τοιαῦταί εἰσιν αἱ μάχαι οἷας πάντες οἱ στρατιῶται φοβοῦνται.

Who is so foolish as not to obey the gods?  Those who don’t obey the gods are punished with death. = τίς οὕτως ἄφρων ἐστὶ ὥστε μὴ πειθέσθαι τοῖς θεοῖς; οἱ μὴ πειθόμενοι τοῖς θεοῖς δίκην διδόασι θανάτου. (OR: οἳ ἂν μὴ πείθωνται τοῖς θεοῖς…)

If ever anyone sends anything to me, I shall sacrifice to the gods. = ἐάν ποτέ τίς τί μοί γε πέμπῃ, θύσω τοῖς θεοῖς.
