εἰ γὰρ νυκτός τε καὶ ἡμέρας ἐκεῖνοί γ΄ οἱ ἀγαθοὶ φύλακες εὖ φυλάττοιντο τοὺς κλέπτας ὡς τὸ τοῦ δήμου ἀργύριον μὴ κλέψωσιν. = If only those good guards would guard well against the thieves both by day and night so that they may not steal the people’s money.

εἴθε οἱ ἄλλοι στρατιῶται μὴ λίποιεν τὴν γέφυραν ἀλλὰ τοὺς πολεμίους κωλύσειαν. = If only the other soldiers would not leave the bridge but would hinder the enemy.

οἱ κακοὶ τὰ τῶν πολιτῶν κλέπτοιεν ἄν. φυλάξωμεν οὖν ἐκείνας τὰς οἰκίας τὰς μικράς. = Bad men might steal the things of the citizens. So let us guard those small houses.

οὔτοι ἐλεύθερος ὃς ἂν τῷ σώματι δουλεύῃ. ἀλλὰ καὶ σοφὸς καὶ ἐλεύθερος οὗ ἂν ἡ ψυχὴ ἄρχῃ. = Whoever is a slave to the body is not free, you know. But whomever the soul rules is both wise and free.

οἳ ἂν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ λείπωνται οὐ λυθήσονται. = Whoever is left on the island will not be freed.

ἆρ΄ ἐκεῖνο πέμψαιμεν ἄν; ἢ τὸ ἄλλο πέμψωμεν; = Could we send that thing? Or are we to send the other thing?

ἐδούλευον οἳ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ οἰκίᾳ λειφθεῖεν. = If anyone was left (behind) in that house, they were a slave.

οὐκ ἀγαθόν γε τὸ ἄνευ ἡγεμόνος τῆς μάχης ἄρχεσθαι. καίτοι οὐκ ἠθελήκασιν οἱ στρατιῶται παύσασθαι ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἀλλὰ τάττονται εἰς μάχην. πείσωμεν οὖν ἐκείνους παύσασθαι. = Starting the battle without a leader is not a good thing, at any rate. And yet the soldiers have not been willing to stop in the plain but are falling into battle order. Let us, therefore, persuade them to stop.

ἀγαθὸς δὴ ὁ ἡγεμὼν ὃς ἂν εὖ τάττῃ τοὺς ὁπλίτας. ἄνευ γὰρ ἡγεμόνος οὐκ εὖ τάττονται οἱ στρατιῶται. = (Any) leader who stations (his) hoplites well is in fact good. For without a leader the soldiers do not fall into (battle) order well.

ὅς τοι τὸν χρυσὸν αἰσχρῶς ἔκλεψεν, ἐκεῖνον γραφὴν κλοπῆς ἂν ἐγράψαντο οἱ πολῖται. = You know, if anyone had shamefully stolen the gold, the citizens would have indicted him on a charge of theft.

ἐκεῖνοί γ΄ οἱ κακοὶ στρατιῶται οἳ τὰ ὅπλα ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἔλιπον μετὰ τὴν μάχην τόν τ΄ ἄργυρον τὸν τοῦ Ὁμήρου καὶ τὰς αἶγας κεκλόφασιν. ἐκείνους οὖν γραψαίμεθα κλοπῆς. = Those evil soldiers who abandoned their arms in the plain after the battle have stolen both Homer’s silver and the goats. If only we would indict them of theft therefore.

πειθοίμεθα διδασκάλοις τοῖς γ΄ ἀγαθοῖς. διδάσκουσι γὰρ τοῖς γράμμασι καὶ τὴν τέχνην καὶ τὴν ἀρετήν. ἄνευ δὴ τέχνης τε καὶ ἀρετῆς οὔτοι καλῶς πράττουσιν οἱ νεανίαι. = If only we would obey the good teachers, at least. For they teach both craft (art) and virtue by (means of) letters (OR: writing). Indeed, without both craft (art) and virtue young men do not fare well, you know.

διδαξώμεθα δὴ τοὺς πέντε ἀδελφοὺς τὴν τοῦ σοφοῦ ποιητοῦ τέχνην. πέμποιεν γὰρ ἂν οἱ πολῖται τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ποιηταῖς δῶρα, ἢ στεφάνους ἢ χρυσόν. = Let us in fact teach the five brothers the art of the wise poet. For the citizens might send gifts, either crowns or gold, to the good poets.

ὁ μὲν ῥήτωρ τοὺς μακροὺς λόγους γράφει. ὁ δ΄ ἄλλος γράφεται. = While the orator writes the long speeches, the other (man) indicts.

ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ παυσώμεθα. ἐκεῖ γὰρ θύσαιμεν ἂν ταῖς θεοῖς. = Let us stop in the shrine. For we could sacrifice to the goddesses there.

τοὺς μὲν διδάσκει ὁ Ὅμηρος, τοὺς δὲ διδάσκεται. = Homer teaches some (men), while others he causes to be taught.

ἄλλος ἄλλους διδάσκεται. = One man causes some to be taught, another man causes others.

καὶ οἱ κλέπται τῇ γε ῥητορικῇ, τῇ περὶ τοὺς λόγους τέχνῃ, σῴζοιντ΄ ἄν, ἐπειδή τοι ἐν ταῖς δίκαις λόγοις μὲν οἱ ἄνευ γνώμης πείθονται, ἔργοις δὲ οἱ σοφοί. = Even thieves could be saved by (the art of ) rhetoric, the art concerning speeches, since, you know, in lawsuits (courts) those without judgment are persuaded by words, while the wise (are persuaded) by deeds.

αἰσχρὰ ἂν πράττοιτε οἳ τοὺς τῆς οἰκίας ποιήματα μὴ διδάσκοισθε. = You would be doing shameful things if any of you should not have the (people) of the household taught poems.

ἄδηλά τοι τὰ τοῦ πολέμου. θυσώμεθα οὖν περὶ τῶν νῦν. λύσωμεν τὴν εἰρήνην ἢ μή; πείσαιμεν γὰρ ἂν τοὺς πολίτας τὰς οἰκίας λίπειν. = The things of war are surely unclear. So let us consult the gods about the present (affairs). Are we to dissolve the peace or not? For we might (could) persuade the citizens to abandon (their) houses.

εἰ γὰρ θύσαιμεν αἶγας τοῖς θεοῖς, τοῖς τῶν πολίτων σωτῆρσιν. = If only we would sacrifice goats to the gods, (to) the saviors of the citizens.

εἰ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ μὴ ἐτάχθης, ἔσωσας ἂν τοὺς ἀδελφούς. = If you had not been stationed in the plain, you would have saved (your) brothers.

οὐ μικρὰ ἡ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ποιητοῦ τιμή. καὶ οὐ μικρὰ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ἡ τῶν ἐκείνου βιβλίων τιμή. = The honor of the good poet is not small. Not small, too, is the price of his books in the market place.

ἐκεῖ παυσαίμεθα ἵνα τοὺς ξένους παύσωμεν. = I wish we would stop there so that we may stop the strangers.

δῆλοι τοῖς γε στρατιώταις οἱ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ λίθοι. = To the soldiers, at least, the stones in the plain are visible.



If only the animals and the money may be sent to the island by the men in the market place. The (inhabitants) of the island could sacrifice to the gods. = εἰ γὰρ τὰ ζῴα καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον πεμφθείη εἰς τὴν νῆσον ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ. οἱ τῆς νήσου θύσαιεν ἂν τοῖς θεοῖς.

I wish that the young men may be well taught by the words of the wise poet. They would then be on guard, at least, against the enemy. = εἰ γὰρ οἱ νεανίοι εὖ παιδευθεῖεν τοῖς τοῦ σοφοῦ ποιητοῦ λόγοις. φυλάττοιντο γ΄οὖν τοὺς πολεμίους.

May the gods save the assembly and the council. Let us not leave the soldiers in the country. = εἰ γὰρ οἱ θεοὶ σῴζοιεν τήν τ’ ἐκκλησίαν καὶ τὴν βουλήν. μὴ λίπωμεν (λείπωμεν) τοὺς στρατιώτας ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ.

The goats of the men of the plain might be stolen by the enemy. Do not prevent the men of the plain from guarding their animals. = οἱ τῶν τοῦ πεδίου ἀνθρώπων αἶγες ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων κλαπεῖεν ἄν. μὴ κωλύητε τοὺς τοῦ πεδίου (ἀνθρώπους) φυλάττειν τὰ ζῷα.
